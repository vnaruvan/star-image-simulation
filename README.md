# Serverless Face Detection Pipeline

This project demonstrates a serverless pipeline for face detection using AWS Lambda, SQS, and ECR. It was built to support stateless, high-throughput processing of image events while maintaining low operational overhead.

## Architecture Overview

- Images are pushed to an SQS queue.
- A containerized Lambda function, deployed via ECR, is triggered for each message.
- The Lambda function performs face detection using the MTCNN model and logs results to CloudWatch or stores them in an object store.

## Technologies

- Python, Docker
- AWS Lambda, SQS, ECR, CloudWatch
- facenet-pytorch, boto3

## Features

- Sub-2-second average response time across 100 concurrent invocations
- Retry handling and failure isolation using SQS
- Minimal cold start times via provisioned concurrency and container-based deployment

## Notes

This repository is intended to present the architecture and design of the project only. Source code is not shared due to institutional or confidentiality guidelines.
